# Portfolio_Website

 This repo is here for me to create my website on.
 
 This website will have both experimental pages and live pages, both of these will detail the different features and effects that I can create/implement into a website

 There will be a mix of the following implemented in this website:
 	- HTML
 	- CSS
 	- JavaScript
 		.jQuery
 	- Bootstrap
 	- Packages
 		.Slick - https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
